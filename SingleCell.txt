An autonomous single celled organism simulation.

Cell(s) will accelerate toward the mouse cursor.

Physics lines can be toggled with the upper or lower case 'L' key.
The displayed lines are magnified for better visibility to the user.
The red 'V' line indicates velocity and is magnified 10x.
The green 'A' line indicates acceleration and is magnified 100x.

Built with processing.


Changlelog:

alpha 0007:
- added Timer class and frametime display. Changed sourcefile version numbering to a per-file basis.

alpha 0006:
-added generic Agent class. Cell is now a child class that inherits from Agent. 
  This will allow us to create Agents of other forms later for a more diverse simulation. 

alpha 0005:
-update cell visual presentation. velocity and acceleration are now displayed more organically.
